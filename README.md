# Classroom-API
Assessment for API week
Get and getall function as expected
Create and delete may function but I ran out of time to test properly.

The next steps would have been to flesh out the classroom class and add get and update methods to it.
The plan was to have a classroom function that would retrieve all everything with the same classroom ID which should have produced a list of everyone/thing in class 1/2.
Most of the commits were within the rest branch as this was where the main issue was found witht he beanxml being in the wrong location.
